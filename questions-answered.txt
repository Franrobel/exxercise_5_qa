By entering git log --stat in the command line, we will not only see all the commits that we made from the recent to the oldest ones with their commit references, username of who made that commit, the date of when that commit was made and the commit message; but also we'll see the files that were involved in each of the commits. 

2. How do you see the contents of what changed within each file from the git log?

3. What does HEAD refer to in the context of git? (Not to be confused with the "HEAD<<<<" one observes within merge conflict)
